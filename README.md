# TestPrepWeb Project

## About the Project

This project is an online quiz created with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It aims to offer users an engaging and interactive way to test and expand their knowledge in various subject areas.
Users can integrate the `jsonschema.json` into their IDE to implement and validate individual questions and answers in the `fragen.json`. This helps to avoid errors in self-created questions and answers.

## Current Status

### Completed Items

- **Basic structure of the quiz**: The foundational structure of the quiz with questions, answer options, and navigation buttons ("Back" and "Next Question") has been implemented.
- **Stylesheet optimizations**: Improvements in the `styles.css` for a consistent and appealing user interface.
- **Dynamic question display**: Questions and answers are dynamically loaded from a JSON file.
- **Feedback color display**: Feedback is displayed with a gray background.
- **Improvement of feedback display**: Implementation of a color coding for the feedback (green for correct answers, red for incorrect answers) and adjustment of the font color accordingly.
- **Center alignment of the feedback background**: Adjustment of the alignment so that the feedback background is centered and consistent with the layout of the questions and answers.
- **Display of performance on the first attempt**: Addition of a feature to display the number of questions answered correctly on the first attempt.

### Still to Do

- **Adjustment of button positions**: Ensure that the "Back" and "Next Question" buttons remain static regardless of the text length of the question or answer options.
- **Write tests**: Thoroughly test and ensure that TestPrepWeb functions consistently across different browsers and devices.
- **Justification for questions**: Consider whether the questions should be displayed in justified text to improve readability.

## Planned Features

- **Responsive design**: Optimization of the quiz application for different screen sizes and devices.
- **Overview of incorrect answers**: Create an overview that displays the incorrectly answered questions along with the correct answers so that users can internalize them again.
- **Languages**: Provide the application in multiple languages


## Continuous Development

- **Expansion of the question catalog**: Addition of more questions and subject areas to the quiz.

## Contribution

- **Feedback and collaboration**: Feedback and contributions are welcome! Feel free to open issues or create pull requests for suggested improvements.
